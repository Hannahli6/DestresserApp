# Destresser
A website that could be a useful tool for reducing, if not eliminating, stress from your day-to-day basis

## Inspiration
The problem we decided to tackle for the hackathon was helping teenagers deal with their stress. The teenage period is one of the most difficult periods of a person’s life, and we wanted to change that. We think this is a problem for a lot of teenagers that has a simple solution. To find a solution, we identified that one of the major causes was that teenagers have little time off to think and relax. For the hackathon, we created a web app that could be a useful tool for reducing, if not eliminating, stress from their lives. We’re calling it Destresser.

## What it does
The Destresser web app is composed of two pages: a timed stretch exercise page and a journaling page. 

### Timed Stretches
On the timed stetches page, the user can set a certain amount of time that they would like to relax for. Along with buttons underneath that play calming tracks like rain, forest, piano, and coffee shop ambience. The user can also pull out a sidebar where they can find some calming stretches to do while the timer is going. The stretches chosen are meant to be done slowly and at your own pace. This section of our app can teach the users some simple ways to destress by focusing on their body and not their mind.

### Stress Journal
Recording your thoughts can be an important part of the destressing process. It can help you let go of stress from school, friends, or family, even if it's only for a little while. Because of its usefulness, we thought it would be a good idea to include it in Detresser. It's encouraged for the user to write about their stress or write about their day in the journal in order to not contstantly think about their stress or to "get rid" of some unnecessarily thoughts about of their head. 

## What’s next for our app?
This idea is relevant these days, as the Internet progresses so as the speed of information we get. Sometimes you just need to leave the marathon, stop, relax and rethink. We see our web app as a mobile companion app, with better accessibility and convenience for users. With a phone app, it can notify the user about planned stretches and relax times. It would be a much easier habit to incorporate into someone’s routine. We are also considering using chatbot mechanics. The users will be able to chat with the bot and tell it about their problems/stresses and the chatbot can give them useful and professional advice that can help them deal with their problems.
